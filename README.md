I hate the school.

It's a place of boredom and frustation.

It's a place of stress snd anxiety.

It's a place where creativity and individuality are suppressed.

It's a place where you're judge and evaluated.

And It's a place where you're not always allowed to be yourself.

I hate the school...

But I have to go.
